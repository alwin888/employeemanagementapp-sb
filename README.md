## Notes

- All endpoints use JSON for input and output.
- Pagination defaults to 20 results per page for employee lists.
- Promotion endpoint enforces historical consistency: fromDate must be after the last salary/title/department change.
- For POST /employees/promote, make sure all fields are valid and the JSON body is properly formatted.
